Two different symbols can therefore have the sign
(the written sign or the sound sign) in common -- they then
signify in different ways.</p>

It can never indicate the common characteristic of
two objects that we symbolize them with the same signs but by
different <i>methods of symbolizing</i>.  For the sign is
arbitrary.  We could therefore equally well choose two
different signs and where then would be what was common in the
symbolization.</p>

In the language of everyday life it very often
happens that the s ame word signifies in two different ways --
and therefore belongs to two different symbols -- or that two
words, which signify in different ways, are apparently applied
in the same way in the proposition.</p>
<p>Thus the word "is" appears as the copula, as the sign
of equality, and as the expression of existence; "to exist" as
an intransitive verb like "to go"; "identical" as an
adjective; we speak of <i>something</i> but also of the fact of
<i>something</i> happening.</p>
<p>(In the proposition "Green is
green" -- where the first word is a proper name as
the last an adjective -- these words have not merely different
meanings but they are <i>different symbols</i>.)</p>

Thus there easily arise the most fundamental
confusions (of which the whole of philosophy is full).</p>

In order to avoid these errors, we must employ a
symbolism which exlucdes them, by not applying the same sign in
different symbols and by not applying signs in the same way
which signify in different ways.  A symbolism, that is to say,
which obeys the rules of <i>logical</i> grammar -- of logical
syntax.</p>
<p>(The logical symbolism of Frege and Russell is such a
language, which, however, does still not exclude all errors.)</p>

<dt> <a href="t3326en.html">3.326</a>

In order to recognize the symbol in the sign we
must consider the significant use.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t3327en.html">3.327</a>
</dt>
<dd>
The sign determines a logical form only together
with its logical syntactic application.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t3328en.html">3.328</a>
</dt>
<dd>
If a sign is <i>not necessary</i> then it is
meaningless.  That is the meaning of Occam's razor.</p>
<p>(If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign
had meaning, then it has meaning.)</p>
