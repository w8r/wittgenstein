If there are logical primitive signs a correct
logic must make clear their position relative to one another
and justify their existence.  The construction of logic <i>out
of</i> its primitive signs must become clear.</p>

If logic has primitive ideas these must be
independent of one another.  If a primitive idea is introduced
it must be introduced in all contexts in which it occurs at
all.  One cannot therefore introduce it for <i>one</i> context
and then again for another.  For example, if denial is
introduced, we must understand it in propositions of the form
"~<i>p</i>", just as in propositions like
"~(<i>p</i> v <i>q</i>)",
"(<img src="exists.gif"
		alt=" EXISTS "><i>x</i>) . ~<i>fx</i>" and others.
We may not first introduce it for oone class of cases and then
for another, for it would then remain doubtful whether its
meaning in the two cases was the same, and there would be no
reason to use the same way of symbolizing in the two cases.</p>
<p>(In short, what Frege ("Grundgesetze der
Arithmetik") has said about the introduction of
signs by definitions holds, mutatis mutandis, for the
introduction of primitive signs also.)</p>

The introduction of a new expedient in the
symbolism of logic must always be an event full of
consequences.  No new symbol may be introduced in logic in
brackets or in the margin -- with, so to speak, an entirely
innocent face.</p>
<p>(Thus in the "Principia
Mathematica" of Russell and Whitehead there occur
definitions and primitive propositions in words.  Why suddenly
words here?  This would need a justification.  There was none,
and can be none for the process is actually not allowed.)</p>
<p>But if the introduction of a new expedient has proved
necessary in one place, we must immediately ask: Where is this
expedient <i>always</i> to be used?  Its position in logic must be
made clear.</p>

All numbers in logic must be capable of
justification.</p>
<p>Or rather it must become plain that there are no
numbers in logic.</p>
<p>There are no pre-eminent numbers.</p>

In logic there is no side by side, there can be no
classification.</p>
<p>In logic there cannot be a more general and a more
special.</p>
