So all problems disappear which are connected with
such pseudo-propositions.</p>
<p>This is the place to solve all the problems with arise
through Russell's "Axiom of Infinity".</p>
<p>What the axiom of infinity is meant to say would be
expressed in language by the fact that there is an infinite
number of names with different meanings.</p>

There are certain cases in which one is tempted
to use expressions of the form "<i>a=a</i>" or
"<i>p</i> <img src="hook.gif"
		alt=" HOOK "> <i>p</i>" As, for instance, when one would
speak of the archtype Proposition, Thing, etc.  So Russell in
the <i>Princples of Mathematics</i> has rendered the nonsense
"<i>p</i> is a proposition" in symbols by
"<i>p</i> <img src="hook.gif"
		alt=" HOOK "> <i>p</i>" and has put it as hypothesis before
certain propositions to show that their places for arguments
could only be occurpied by propositions.</p>
<p>(It is nonsense to place the hypothesis
<i>p</i> <img src="hook.gif"
		alt=" HOOK "> <i>p</i> before a proposition in order to ensure that
its arguments have the right form, because the hypotheses for a
non-proposition as arugment becomes not false but meaningless,
and because the proposition itself becomes senseless for
arguments of the wrong kind, and therefore it survives the
wrong arguments no better and no worse than the senseless
hypthesis attached for this purpose.)</p>

Similarly it was proposed to express "There are
no things" by "~(<img src="exists.gif"
		alt=" EXISTS "><i>x</i>) . <i>x=x</i>".  But even if
this were a proposition -- would it not be true if indeed
"There were things", but these were not identical with
themselves?</p>
