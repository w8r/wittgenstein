Here it becomes clear that there are no such things
as "logical objects" or "logical constants" (in the sense of
Frege and Russell).</p>

For all those results of truth-operations on
truth-functions are identical, which are one and the same
truth-function of elementary propositions.</p>

That v, <img src="hook.gif"
		alt=" HOOK ">, etc., are not relations in
the sense of right and left, etc., is obvious.</p>
<p>The possibility of crosswise definition of the logical
"primitive signs" of Frege and Russell
shows by itself that these are not primitive signs and that
they signify no relations.</p>
<p>And it is obvious that the "<img src="hook.gif"
		alt=" HOOK ">" which we define by
means of "~" and "v" is identical with that by which we
define "v" with the help of "~", and that this "v" is
the same as the first, and so on.</p>

That from a fact <i>p</i> an infinite number of
<i>others</i> should follow, namely, ~~<i>p</i>, ~~~~<i>p</i>, etc., is
indeed hardly to be believed, and it is no less wonderful that
the infinite number of propositions of logic (of mathematics)
shold follow from half a dozen "primitive
propositions".</p>
<p>But the propositions of logic say the same thing.  That
is, nothing.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t544en.html"><b>5.44</b></a>

<dd>
Truth-functions are not material functions.</p>
<p>If <i>e.g.</i> an affirmation can be produced by repeated
denial, is the denial -- in any sense -- contained in the
affirmation?</p>
<p>Does "~~<i>p</i>" deny "~<i>p</i>", or does it affirm
<i>p</i>; or both?</p>
<p>The proposition "~~<i>p</i>" does
not treat of denial as an object, but the possibility of denial
is already prejudged in affirmation.</p>
<p>And if there was an object called "~", then
"~~<i>p</i>" would have to say something other than
"<i>p</i>".  For the one proposition would then treat of ~, the
other would not.</p>

If there are logical primitive signs a correct
logic must make clear their position relative to one another
and justify their existence.  The construction of logic <i>out
of</i> its primitive signs must become clear.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t546en.html"><b>5.46</b></a>
</dt>
<dd>
When we have rightly introduced the logical signs,
the sense of all their combinations has been already introduced
with them: therefore not only
"<i>p</i> v <i>q</i>" but also
"~(<i>p</i> v ~<i>q</i>)", etc. etc.  We should then already have
introduced the effect of all possible combinations of brackets;
and it would then have become clear that the proper general
primitive signs are not "<i>p</i> v <i>q</i>",
"(<img src="exists.gif"
		alt=" EXISTS "><i>x</i>) . <i>fx</i>", etc., but the
most general form of their combinations.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t547en.html"><b>5.47</b></a>
</dt>
<dd>
It is clear that everything which can be said
<i>beforehand</i> about the form of <i>all</i> propositions at all
can be said <i>on one occasion</i>.</p>
<p>For all logical operations are already contained in the
elementary proposition.  For "<i>fa</i>"
says the same as "(<img src="exists.gif"
		alt=" EXISTS "><i>x</i>) . <i>fx . x=a</i>".</p>
<p>Where there is composition, there is argument and
function, and where these are, all logical constants already
are.</p>
<p>One could say: the one logical constant is that which
<i>all</i> propositions, according to their nature, have in common
with one another.</p>
<p>That however is the general form of proposition.</p>
