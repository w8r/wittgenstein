The gramophone record, the musical thought, the
score, the waves of sound, all stand to one another in that
pictorial internal relation, which holds between language and
the world.</p>
<p>To all of them the logical structure is common.</p>
<p>(Like the two youths, their two horses and their lilies
in the story.  They are all in a certain sense one.)</p>

In the fact that there is a general rule by which
the musician is able to read the symphony out of the score, and
that there is a rule by which one could reconstruct the
symphony from the line on a gramophone reord and from this
again -- by means of the first rule -- construct the score,
herein lies the internal similarity between these things which
at first sight seem to be entirely different.  And the rule is
the law of projection which projects the symphony into the
language of the musical score.  It is the rule of translation
of this language into the language of the gramophone record.</p>
