We cannot compare any process with the "passage of
time" -- there is no such thing -- but only with another
process (say, with the movement of the chonometer).</p>
<p>Hence the description of the temporal sequence of events is
only possible if we support ourselves on another process.</p>
<p>It is exactly analogous for space.  When, for example, we
say that neither of two events (which mutually exclude one
another) can occur, because there is <i>no cause</i> why the one
should occur rather than the other, it is really a matter of
our being unable to descibe <i>one</i> of the two events unless
there is some sort of asymmetry.  And if there <i>is</i> such an
asymmetry, we can regard this as the <i>cause</i> of the occurrence
of the one and of the non-occurrence of the other.</p>

The Kantian problem of the right and left hand which
cannot be made to cover one another already exists in the
plane, and even in one-dimensional space; where the two
congruent figures <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> cannot be made to cover one
another without

moving them out of this space.  The right and left hand are in
fact completely congruent.  And the fact that they cannot be
made to cover one another has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>A right-hand glove could be put on a left hand if it could
be turned round in four-dimensional space.</p>
