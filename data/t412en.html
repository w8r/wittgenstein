Propositions can represent the whole reality, but
they cannot represent what they must have in common with
reality in order to be able to represent it -- the logical
form.</p>
<p>To be able to represent the logical form, we should
have to be able to put ourselves with the propositions outside
logic, that is outside the world.</p>

Propositions cannot represent the logical form:
this mirrors itself in the propositions.</p>
<p>That which mirrors itself in language, language cannot
represent.</p>
<p>That which expresses <i>itself</i> in language, <i>we</i>
cannot express by language.</p>
<p>The propositions <i>show</i> the logical form of reality.</p>
<p>They exhibit it.</p>

We can speak in a certain sense of formal
properties of objects and atomic facts, or of properties of the
structure of facts, and in the same sense of formal relations
and relations of structures.</p>
<p>(Instead of property of the structure I also say
"internal property"; instead of relation
of structures "internal relation".</p>
<p>I introduce these expressions in order to show the
reason for the confusion, very widespread among philosophers,
betwen internal relations and proper (external) relations.)</p>
<p>The holding of such internal properties and relations
cannot, however, be asserted by propositions, but it shows
itself in the propositions, which present the facts and treat
of the objects in question.</p>
</dd>

<dd>
A property is internal if it is unthinkable that
its object does not possess it.</p>
<p>(This bright blue colour and that stand in the internal
relation of bright and darker eo ipso.  It is unthinkable that
<i>these</i> two objects should not stand in this relation.)</p>
<p>(Here to the shifting use of the words "property" and
"relation" there corresponds the shifting use of the word
"object".)</p>

<dd>
The existence of an internal property of a
possible state of affairs is not expressed by a proposition,
but it expresses itself in the proposition which presents that
state of affairs, by an intern al property of this proposition.</p>
<p>It would be as senseless to ascribe a formal property
to a proposition as to deny it the formal property.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t4125en.html"><b>4.125</b></a>
</dt>
<dd>
The existence of an internal relation between
possible states of affairs expresses itself in language by an
internal relation between the propositions presenting them.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t4126en.html">4.126</a>
</dt>
<dd>
In the sense in which we speak of formal
properties we can now speak also of formal concepts.</p>
<p>(I introduce this expression in order to make clear the
confusion of formal concepts with proper concepts which runs
through the whole of the old logic.)</p>
<p>That anything falls under a formal concept as an
object belonging to it, cannot be expressed by a proposition.
But it is shown in the symbol for the object itself.  (The name
shows that it signifies an object, the numerical sign that it
signifies a number, etc.)</p>
<p>Formal concepts, cannot, like proper concepts, be
presented by a function.</p>
<p>For their characteristics, the formal properties, are
not expressed by the functions.</p>
<p>The expression of a formal property is a feature of
certain symbols.</p>
<p>The sign that signifies the charcteristics of a formal
concept is, therefore, a characteristic feature of all symbols,
whose meanings fall under the concept.</p>
<p>The expression of the formal concept is therefore a
propositional variable in which only this characteristic
feature is constant.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t4127en.html"><b>4.127</b></a>
</dt>
<dd>
The propositional variable signifies the formal
concept, and its values signify the objects which fall under
this concept.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t4128en.html">4.128</a>
</dt>
<dd>
The logical forms are <i>anumerical</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore there are in logic no pre-eminent numbers,
and therefore there is no philosophical monism or dualism, etc.</p>
