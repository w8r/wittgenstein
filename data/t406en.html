If one does not observer that propositions have a
sense independent of the facts, one can easily believe that
true and false are two relations between signs and things
signified with equal rights.</p>
<p>One could, then, for example, say that "<i>p</i>"
signifies in the true way what "~<i>p</i>" signifies in the
false way, etc.</p>

<dd>
Can we not make ourselves understood by means of
false propositions as hitherto with true ones, so long as we
know that they are meant to be false?  No!  For a proposition
is true, if what we assert by means of it is the case; and if
by "<i>p</i>" we mean ~<i>p</i>, and what we
mean is the case, then "<i>p</i>" in the
new conception is true and not false.</p>

An illustration to explain the concept of truth.
A black spot on white paper; the form of the spot can be
described by saying of each point of the plane whether it is
white or black.  To the fact that a point is black corresponds
a positive fact; to the fact that a point is white (not black),
a negative fact.  If I indicate a point of the plane (a
truth-value in Frege's terminology), this corresponds to
the assumption proposed for judgement, etc. etc.</p>
<p>But to be able to say that a point is black or white, I
must first know under what conditions a point is called white
or black; in order to be able to say "<i>p</i>" is true (or
false) I must have determined under what conditions I call
"<i>p</i>" true, and thereby I determine the sense of the
proposition.</p>
<p>The point at which the simile breaks down is this: we
can indicate a point on the paper, without know what white and
black are; but to a proposition without a sense corresponds n
othing at all, for it signifies no thing (truth-value) whose
properties are called "false" or
"true"; the verb of the proposition is
not "is true" or "is
false" -- as Frege thought -- but that which
"is true" must already contain the verb.</p>

<dd>
Every proposition must <i>already</i> have a sense;
assertion cannot give it a sense, for what it asserts is the
sense itself.  And the same holds of denial, etc.</p>
