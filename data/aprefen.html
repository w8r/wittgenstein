<p><b>Preface</b></p>

<hr>

<p>This book will perhaps only be understood by those who have
themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed in
it -- or similar thoughts.  it is therefore not a text-book.
Its object would be attained if it afforded pleasure to one who
read it with understanding.</p>

<p>The book deals with the problems of philosophy and shows, as
I believe, that the method of formulating these problems
rests on the misunderstanding of the logic of our language.  Its
whole meaning could be summed up somewhat as follows: What can
be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot
speak thereof one must be silent.</p>

<p>The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or
rather -- not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts;
for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we should have to be
able to thnk both sides of this limit (we should therefore have
to be able to think what cannot be thought).</p>

<p>The limit can, therefore, only be drawn in language and what
lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense.</p>

<p>How far my efforts agree with those of other philosophers I
will not decide.  Indeed what I have here written makes no
claim to novelty in points of detail; and therefore I give no
sources, because it is indifferent to me whether what I have
thought has already been thought before my by another.</p>

<p>I will only mention that to the great works of Frege and the
writings of my friend Bertrand Russell I owe in large measure
the stimulation of my thoughts.</p>

<p>If this work has a value it consists in two things.  First
that in it thoughts are expressed, and this value will be the
greater the better the thoughts are expressed.  the more the
nail has been hit on the heard. -- Here I am conscious that I
have fallen far short of the possible.  Simply because my
powers are insufficient to cope with the task.  -- May others
come and do it better.</p>

<p>On the other hand the <i>truth</i> of the thoughts
communicated here seems to me unassailable and definitive.  I
am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems have in
essentials been finally solved.  And if I am not mistaken in
this, then the value of this work secondly consists in the fact
that it shows how little has been done when these problems have
been solved.</p>
