We must now answer a priori the question as to all
possible forms of the elementary propositions.</p>
<p>The elementary proposition consists of names.  Since we
cannot give the number of names with different meanings, we
cannot give the composition of the elementary proposition.</p>

Our fundamental principle is that every question
which can be decided at all by logic can be decided off-hand.</p>
<p>(And if we get into a situation where we need to answer
such a problem by looking at the world, this shows that we are
on a fundamentally wrong track.)</p>

<dd>
The "experience" which we
need to understand logic is not that such and such is the case,
but that something <i>is</i>; but that is <i>no</i> experience.</p>
<p>Logic <i>precedes</i> every experience -- that something
is <i>so</i>.</p>
<p>It is before the How, not before the What.</p>

Russell said that there were simple relations
between different numbers of things (individuals).  But between
what numbers?  And how should this be decided -- by experience?</p>
<p>(There is no pre-eminent number.)</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t5554en.html"><b>5.554</b></a>

<dd>
The enumeration of any special forms would be
entirely arbitrary.</p>

<dd>
It is clear that we have a concept of the
elementary proposition apart from its special logical form.</p>
<p>Where, however, we can build symbols according to a
system, there this system is the logically important thing and
not the single symbols.</p>
<p>And how would it be possible that I should have to deal
with forms in logic which I can invent: but I must have to deal
with that which makes it possible for me to invent them.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t5556en.html"><b>5.556</b></a>
</dt>
<dd>
There cannot be a hierarchy of the forms of the
elementary propositions.  Only that which we ourselves
construct can we foresee.</p>
</dd>
<dt> <a href="t5557en.html"><b>5.557</b></a>
</dt>
<dd>
The <i>application</i> of logic decides what
elementary propositions there are.</p>
<p>What lies in its application logic cannot anticipate.</p>
<p>It is clear that logic may not conflict with its
application.</p>
<p>But logic must have contact with its application.</p>
<p>Therefore logic and its application may not overlap one
another.</p>
