All propositions, such as the law of causation, the
law of continuity in nature, the law of least expenditure in
nature, etc. etc., all these are a priori intuitions of
possible forms of the propositions of science,</p>

Newtonian mechanics, for example, brings the
description of the universe to a unified form.  Let us imagine
a white surface with irregular black spots.  We now say:
Whatever kind of picture these make I can always get as near as
I like to its description, if I cover the surface with a
sufficiently fine square network and now say of every square
that it is white or black.  In this way I shall have rbought
the description of the surface to a unified form.  This form is
arbitrary, because I could have applied with equal success a
net with a triangular or hexagonal mesh.  It can happen that
the description would have been simpler with the aid of a
triangular mesh; that is to say we might have described the
surface more accurately with a triangular, and coarser, than
with the finer square mesh, or vice versa, and so on.  To the
different networks correspond different systems of describing
the world. Mechanics determine a form of description by saying:
All propositions in the description of the world must be
obtained in a given way from a number of given propositions --
the mechanical axioms.  It thus provides the bricks for
building the edifice of science, and says: Whatever building
thou wouldst erect, thou shalt construct it in some manner
with these bricks and these alone.</p>
<p>(As with the system of numbers one must be able to write
down any arbitrary number, so with the system of mechanics one
must be able to write down any arbitrary physical proposition.)</p>
</dd>

And now we see the relative position of logic and
mechanics.  (We could construct the network out of figures of
different kinds, as out of triangles and hexagons together.)
That a picture like that instanced above can be described by a
network of a given form asserts <i>nothing</i> about the picture.
(for this holds of every picture of this kind.)  But <i>this</i>
does characterize the picture, the fact, namely, that it can be
<i>completely</i> described by a definite net of <i>definite</i> fineness.</p>
<p>So too the fact that it can be described by Newtonian
mechanics asserts nothing about the world; but <i>this</i> asserts
something, namely, that it can be described in that particular
way in which as a matter of fact it is described.  the fact,
too, that it can be described more simply by one system of
mechanics than by another says something about the world.</p>

Mechanics is an attempt to construct according to a
single plan all <i>true</i> propositions which we need forthe
description of the world.</p>
