Newtonian mechanics, for example, brings the
description of the universe to a unified form.  Let us imagine
a white surface with irregular black spots.  We now say:
Whatever kind of picture these make I can always get as near as
I like to its description, if I cover the surface with a
sufficiently fine square network and now say of every square
that it is white or black.  In this way I shall have rbought
the description of the surface to a unified form.  This form is
arbitrary, because I could have applied with equal success a
net with a triangular or hexagonal mesh.  It can happen that
the description would have been simpler with the aid of a
triangular mesh; that is to say we might have described the
surface more accurately with a triangular, and coarser, than
with the finer square mesh, or vice versa, and so on.  To the
different networks correspond different systems of describing
the world. Mechanics determine a form of description by saying:
All propositions in the description of the world must be
obtained in a given way from a number of given propositions --
the mechanical axioms.  It thus provides the bricks for
building the edifice of science, and says: Whatever building
thou wouldst erect, thou shalt construct it in some manner
with these bricks and these alone.</p>
<p>(As with the system of numbers one must be able to write
down any arbitrary number, so with the system of mechanics one
must be able to write down any arbitrary physical proposition.)</p>
