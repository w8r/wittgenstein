For an answer which cannot be expressed the question
too cannot be expressed.</p>
<p><i>The riddle</i> does not exist.</p>

answered.</p>

Scepticism is <i>not</i> irrefutable, but palpably
senseless, if it would doubt where a question cannot be asked.</p>
<p>For doubt can only exist where there is a question; a
question only where there is an answer, and this only where
something <i>can be said</i>.</p>

<dd>
We feel that even if <i>all possible</i> scientific
questions be asnwered, the problems of life have still not been
touched at all.  Of course there is then no question left, and
just this is the answer.</p>

The right method of philosophy would be this: To say
nothing except what can be said, <i>i.e.</i> the propositions of
natural science, <i>i.e.</i> something that has nothing to do with
philosophy: and then always, when someone else wished to say
something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had given
no meaning to certain signs in his propositions.  This method
would be unsatisfying to the other -- he would not have the
feeling that we were teaching him philosophy -- but it would be
the only strictly correct method.</p>

My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who
understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has
climbed out through them, on them, over them.  (He must so to
speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)</p>
<p>He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world
rightly.</p>
