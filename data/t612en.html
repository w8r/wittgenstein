The fact that the propositions of logic are
tautologies <i>shows</i> the formal -- logical -- properties of
language, of the world.</p>
<p>That its constituent parts connected together <i>in this
way</i> give a tautology characterizes the logic of its
constituent parts.</p>
<p>In order that propositions connected together in a definite
way may give a tautology they must have definite properties of
structure.  That they give a tautology when <i>so</i> connected
shows therefore that they possess these properties of structure.</p>

The propositions of logic demonstrate the logical
properties of propositions, by combining them into propositions
which say nothing.</p>
<p>This method could be called a zero-method.  In a logical
proposition propositions are brought into equilibrium with one
another, and the state of equilibrium then shows how these
propositions must be logically constructed.</p>

Whence it follows that we can get on without logical
propositions, for we can recognize in an adequate notation the
formal properties of the propositions by mere inspection.</p>

It is clear that the laws of logic cannot themselves
obey further logical laws.</p>
<p>(There is not, as Russell supposed, for every "type" a
special law of contradiction; but one is sufficient, since it
is not applied to itself.)</p>

The logical propositions describe the scaffolding of
the world, or rather they present it.  They "treat" of
nothing.  They presuppose that names have meaning, and that
elementary propositions have sense.  And this is their
connexion with the world.  It is clear that it must show
something about the world that certain combinations of symbols
-- which essentially have a definite character -- are
tautologies.  Herein lies the decisive point.  We said that in
the symbols which we use something is arbitrary, something
not.  In logic only this expresses: but this means that in
logic it is not <i>we</i> who express, by means of signs, what we
want, but in logic the nature of the essentially necessary
signs itself asserts.  That is to say, if we know the logical
syntax of any sign language, then all the propositions of logic
are already given.</p>

It is possible, also with the old conception of logic,
to give at the outset a description of all "true" logical
propositions.</p>

<dd>
Whether a proposition belongs to logic can be
calculated by calculating the logical properties of the
<i>symbol</i>.</p>
<p>And this we do when we prove a logical proposition.  For
without troubling ourselves about a sense and a meaning, we
form the logical propositions out of others by mere <i>symbolic
rules</i>.</p>
<p>We prove a logical proposition by creating it out of other
logical propositions by applying in succession certain
operations, which again generate tautologies out of the first.
(And from a tautology only tautologies <i>follow</i>.)</p>
<p>Naturally this way of showing that its propositions are
tautologies is quite unessential to logic.  Because the
propositions, from which the proof starts, must show without
proof that they are tautologies.</p>

All propositions of logic are of equal rank; there are
not some which are essentially primitive and others deduced
from there.</p>
<p>Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.</p>
