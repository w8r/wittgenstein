Logic must take care of itself.</p>
<p>A <i>possible</i> sign must also be able to signify.
Everything which is possible in logic is also permitted.
("Socrates is identical" means nothing because there is no
property which is called "identical".  The proposition is
senseless beause we have not made some arbitrary determination,
not because the symbol is in itself unpermissible.)</p>
<p>In a certain sense we cannot make mistakes in logic.</p>

Self-evidence, of which Russell has said so much,
can only be discard in logic by language itself preventing
every logical mistake.  That logic is a priori consists in the
fact that we <i>cannot</i> think illogically.</p>

Frege says: Every legitimately constructed
proposition msut have a sense; and I say: Every possible
proposition is legitimately constructed, and if it has no sense
this can only be because we have given no <i>meaning</i> to some
of its constituent parts.</p>
<p>(Even if we believe that we have done so.)</p>
<p>Thus "Socrates is identical" says
nothing, because we have given <i>no</i> meaning to the word
"identical" as <i>adjective</i>.  For when
it occurs as the isng of equality it symbolizes in an entirely
different way -- the symbolizing relation is another --
therefore the symbol is in the two cases entirely different;
the two symbols have the sign in common with one another only
by accident.</p>
